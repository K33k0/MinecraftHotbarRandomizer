- Move the sliders to adjust the probability of that block being placed; the higher the slider, the more chance of that one being used.

- Each *##* corresponds to the hotbar shortcuts, number one being left most on your hotbar.


For example you could use stone on slot 1 with with a weight (slider) of 5. Then in slot 2 lets say andesite with a weight of 1. Now when playing minecraft,
with the applet turned on, everytime you right click it there will be a high chance of stone being used and a low chance of andesite.
It's a great way of adding some random noise.

# !Important note!

The time delay is in milliseconds.

Due to how fast the applet switches the hotbar and places the block, a delay has been implemented. Depending on how fast your connection is depends on 
how high this delay will need to be set. I usually find anywhere between 25 and 75 is good. The default value is 50.
